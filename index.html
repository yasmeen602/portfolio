       <p>
        Just like with any other activity,the world of codding is also governed by 
        informal rules. most of these rules are formulated over decades.
        programming languages often remain in usage for longer than their founders expect. 
       </p>
       <p>
        programmers find innovative ways to recreate these languages for different 
        purposes. Thus, some static donats and donats are always of use in the fluid
        zone called coding. Normally, a great code has three common features:
        maintainability, dependablity, and usability. It should also be adoptable
        enough to be efficient even in changing enviroment. However,before
        coding even begins, a few prerequisites needs to be fulfilled in order to 
        provide a solid foundation on which readable code can be writen        
       </p>
       <h2>PREREQUISITES</h2>
       <P>
        This is easily the most important step of all. In absence of these, a
        may be inefficient even if it is completed. the prerequisites that need to
        architecture. An important question is how development is structured. what
        is the specific purpose of the software? the problem that the code is 
        meant to solve must be clear to the developer. what is the design of the 
        individual components? such basic requirements have to be fulfilled when a 
        good code is being written.
       </P>
       <p>
        Hoare makes a good point when it comes to assessing software design and
        architecture.Either a code is so simple that there are obviously no
        errors, or a code is so complex that there are no obvious errors. software
        design adequately addressed. if there are some things that architecture
        cannot take care of, then those are handled in the software design phase.
        A detailed design is a good guide for coding.
       </p>
       <p>
        The next step is to measure exisiting programming languages against the 
        requirements to decide on an appropriate one. If needed, a mixed routine
        can be adopted.
       </p>
       <p>
        once these are met. it because easier to follow some established good
        coding practices.
       </p>
       <ul>
         <li>
           <h3>COMMENTING</h3>
           <P>
            commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by programmers,
            especially for codes that are written by multiple programmers.
            However, comments reduce the cost of knowledge transfer. Name of the 
            module, purpose of the module, description of the module, original
            author, modifications and authours who modified code with a descriptions
            on why it was modified were components of an early commenting
            practice.
           </P> 
         </li>
         <li>
           <h3>GOOD NAMING CONVENTIONS</h3>
           <P>
            Using good naming conventions is the next step to good coding. often
            developers use Y1 or X1 as variables, and then do not replace them
      with meaningful names. To prevent this confusion and utter waste of
      time, descriptive names should be used.
      </P>
      </li>
      <li>
      <h3>SIMPLICITY AND COMPACTNESS</h3>
      <P>
      The key to a good code is also simplicity. To achieve a certain 
      result,developers may use complex logic but this should be minimised 
      while writing a good code. The next developer who uses the code may 
      use it for a different purpose and may not even completely understand 
      or utilise the complex logic. simple code does not always depend on 
      the length of the code, The code must also be conceptually simple. An 
      added advantage is if the code is also suitably compact. More code can 
      be viewed on a page and programmer keystrokes can be reduced. 
      </P>
      </li>
      <li>
      <h3>PORTABILITY</h3>
      <P>Another feature of good code is portability. If the code contains 
      values referring to a absolute parametersa such as file names,URLs or 
      IP adresses,it will not run on a host that is of a different design. 
      A good programmer will parametrize these variables and configure them 
      so the application can also be run and maintained in a different 
      environment 
      </P>
      </li>
      <li>
      <h3>TESTING</h3>
      <P>
      Testing is also a necessary part in the process of coding. 
      Test cases must be planned while the code is being written,and 
      they are developed while an applications is coded.
      </P>
      </li>
      <li>
      <h3>DEBUGGING THE CODE</h3>
      <P>
       While writting a code, it is necessary to check for errors throughout. 
       Though it is fine for smaller programs to be debugged after they have been 
       written, this becomes a bottleneck for longer programmes. The best practice. 
       therefore,is to do debug each module as soon as it has been created.
      </P>
      </li>
      <li>
      <h3>DEPLOYMENT</h3>
      <P>
        Once the code has been written,it has to be deployed. The installation files should be kept 
        to a minimum and updated regularly.Unused code or anything that is not necessary should
        not be installed.
      </P>
      </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The best practices for coding are, most of all, designed to reduce risk whenever there are chances of it.
        For a beginner, a few of these will not be completely applicable.But as a hard-boiled programmer writing 
        numerous codes.All these guidelines will come in handy.since codes can run up to millions of 
        lines at times out dated advice like a keep it simple or a less is priceless and 
        should always be remembered
